                    <p class="lead">Buying a home is likely the largest investment you'll ever make. Before falling in
                        love with granite countertops and staged furniture, it's crucial to look beyond the surface.
                        Here's what experienced renovation professionals check when evaluating a property.</p>

                    <h2>1. Foundation and Structural Integrity</h2>
                    <p>The foundation is literally what your investment rests upon. Look for these warning signs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cracks in foundation walls</strong> - Hairline cracks are often cosmetic, but
                            horizontal cracks or those wider than 1/4" warrant professional evaluation</li>
                        <li><strong>Uneven floors</strong> - Bring a marble or ball and see if it rolls</li>
                        <li><strong>Doors and windows that stick</strong> - Could indicate settling or shifting</li>
                        <li><strong>Gaps between walls and ceiling/floor</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Bowing or leaning walls</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Cost to repair:</strong> Foundation issues can range from $5,000 for minor repairs to
                        $50,000+ for major structural work.</p>

                    <h2>2. Roof Condition and Age</h2>
                    <p>A roof replacement is one of the most expensive repairs a homeowner faces. Check:</p>

                        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Asphalt shingles last 20-25 years; tile can last 50+</li>

                        <li><strong>Wiring type:</strong> Aluminum wiring (1960s-70s) requires special attention</li>

                        <li><strong>GFCI outlets</strong> in kitchens, bathrooms, outdoors</li>

                        <li><strong>Signs of leaks:</strong> Water stains, musty smells, warped flooring</li>
                        <li><strong>Sewer line condition:</strong> Request a sewer scope inspection for older homes</li>

                        <h3>Pro Tip: Get Multiple Inspections</h3>
                        <p>A standard home inspection covers general conditions, but consider specialized inspections
                            for: termites/WDO, sewer lines, pool/spa, roof, and mold. Each costs $100-$500 but can save
                            you thousands.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>6. Water Damage and Mold</h2>
                    <p>Florida's humidity makes mold a serious concern:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Water stains</strong> on ceilings, walls, or around windows</li>
                        <li><strong>Musty odors</strong> especially in closets, bathrooms, basements</li>
                        <li><strong>Bubbling or peeling paint</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Warped or soft flooring</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Previous flood history</strong> - Check FEMA flood maps</li>
                        <li><strong>Visible mold</strong> in bathrooms, under sinks, in attic</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Cost to repair:</strong> Minor mold remediation $500-$3,000; major $10,000-$30,000+</p>

                    <h2>7. Permits and Unpermitted Work</h2>
                    <p>Unpermitted work can become your problem after purchase:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Request permit history</strong> from the local building department</li>
                        <li><strong>Compare to seller disclosures</strong> - All renovations should be listed</li>
                        <li><strong>Look for obvious additions</strong> like enclosed garages, bonus rooms, pools</li>
                        <li><strong>Verify pool permits</strong> - Unpermitted pools can be costly to legalize</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Unpermitted work may need to be brought to code or removed; can affect
                        insurance and resale.</p>

                    <h2>Questions to Ask the Seller</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>How old is the roof, HVAC, and water heater?</li>
                        <li>Have there been any insurance claims on the property?</li>
                        <li>Are there any known defects or issues?</li>
                        <li>What renovations or improvements have been made?</li>
                        <li>Were permits pulled for all work?</li>
                        <li>How long have you owned the home?</li>
                        <li>Why are you selling?</li>
                        <li>What are the average utility costs?</li>
                    </ol>
